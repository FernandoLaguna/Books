# Final Project - Team 4

## Book's Recommendations Based with Machine Learning 

### Introduction

#### Selected Topic (Monse)
#### Reasons Why (Monse)
#### Source of Data Decription (Marco)

We reviewed a couple of sources trying to get enough information that may help us to understand and predict how recommendable a book is based on some of its general information. For this purpose, we reviewed the following potential sources: 

1) Good Reads: A social cataloging website (property of Amazon) where users can register books and create catalogs, reading lists, and rate books. 
2) ISBNdb: Is the world's largest book database that gathers specific information (title, author, publisher, publish date, etc.) for a vast collection of unique books. 

#### Questions to Answer (Fer)

### Team Management

#### Github (Fer - Optional)

#### Communication Protocols (Marco)

To execute this first draft, the team worked together and each one on their own, thus, we established a couple of communication forums using Slack and Whatsapp additionally to schedule some video meetings to define the plan and follow up on deliverables. 

The plan for the rest of the projects is to keep some similar communication forums to ensure we keep track of the remaining deliverables.   

### Data Base (Marco)

For this first mockup we used the Good Reads basis, our logic here is that the selected basis may contain at least: 

  - Proxy of a Recommendation: Variable we want to catalog/ forecast. 

  - Book's General Information: Variables we want to use to explain the Recommendation. 

The selected basis contains a rating per book provided by different users that may be used to generate a recommendation and it also contains general information such as Author, Category, Year of Publication & Num of Pages that may be used to explain the rating and, eventually, generate the recommendation.
