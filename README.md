#### Selected Topic (Monse)
#### Reasons Why (Monse)
#### Source of Data Decription (Marco)

We reviewed a couple of sources trying to get enough information that may help us to understand and predict how recomendable a book is based on some of its general information. For this purpose, we reviewed the following potential sources: 

1) Good Reads: A social cataloging website (property of Amazon) where users can register books and create catalogs, reading lists, and rate books. 
2) ISBNdb: Is the world's largest book database which gathers specific information (title, author, publisher, publish date, etc.) for a vast collection of unique books.
